## Hi there 👋


I'm currently learning about data analysis and the tools required to organize data in an analytical format to be used for bigger business decisions. I am interested in working with data, technology, computers, and coding different systems and functions. Currently, I am a Junior at the University of Cincinnati studying Business Analytics and Information Systems. I am looking for any opportunites to broaden my skills and strengthen my experience with data.
